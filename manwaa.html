    <h2>Exercise 1: "About Me" Page
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>Create a page named aboutme.html that describes you. (You can use DreamWeaver or Notepad++). On your page, include some or all of the following
        information:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your name</li>
            <li>A description of yourself in two sentences or less. Emphasize the most important word(s) by putting them in bold.</li>
            <li>A list of classes you are taking right now at Temple.</li>
            <li>Your 3 favorite movies, books, or TV shows, in order. Make at least one link to an interesting site about that tv show/movie/book, such as its <a href="http//:IMDB.com">IMDB</a> page.
            </li>
            <li>Two images, one that represents you when you're happy and the other to represent you when you're sad. <br>(These can be any images you like. Consider searching for images on <a href="http//:google.com/image search"> Google Image Search
            </a>)</li>
            <li>Something interesting about one or more of your neighbors (people sitting at computers next to you.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>(You may be tempted to spend all 50 of your minutes on this part of the lab. But try to keep the page somewhat short so that you can attempt some of the
            other exercises.)
        <br>
        To see your page in the web browser, <b>in</b> Firefox, click <b>File</b>, <b>Open File</b>... and browse to your page file to open it.

    </p> <br>
    <p>Write your page using valid XHTML 1.1. Include a link from your page to the W3C XHTML Validator, using the following image and linking to the
        following site:</p> <br>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="image: http://www.w3.org/Icons/valid-xhtml11">image: http://www.w3.org/Icons/valid-xhtml11</a></li>
            <li><a href="site: http://validator.w3.org/check/referer
                ">site: http://validator.w3.org/check/referer
            </a></li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>The next task will be to write a stylesheet for your page, so also include a link to the W3C CSS Validator, using the following image and linking to the
            following site:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="image: http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss
                    ">image: http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss
                </a></li>
                <li><a href="site: http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer
                    ">site: http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer
                </a></li>
               
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            <p>For example, the following About Me page describes textbook coauthor, Victoria Kirst (between, but not including, the thick black lines):</p>
<section>
    <h1>About Vectoria Kirst </h1>
    <br>
    <p>My name is Victoria and I am <b>Jolly, Clusmy</b>, and <b>four-eyed.</b></p>

    <h2>Exercise 2: Style Your Page with CSS (roughly 15 minutes)
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>Create a stylesheet named aboutme-style.css to improve the appearance of your About Me page. Your stylesheet should do the following without any
        modification to your HTML code:</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Change the color of at least two elements</li>
    <li>Change the font properties of at least two elements (such as family, size, weight, style). Here are some standard fonts you may want to use:
        Arial, Arial Black, Verdana, Trebuchet MS, Georgia, Tahoma, Courier New, Times New Roman
        </li>
        <li>Change at least one other thing of your choosing (such as background color, text alignment, etc.)
        </li>
</ul>
<p>For example, this is Victoria's styled version of her page in Exercise 1 (between, but not including, the thick black lines):</p>

        <h2>Exercise 3: Validate Your Page and CSS
    
        </h2>
        <br>
        <p>Next, validate your HTML and CSS code to make sure they match the strict XHTML 1.1 specifications. To run the validators, do the following:</p>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Open <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">http://validator.w3.org/</a> (for XHTML) or <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/</a> (for CSS)
        </li>
        <li>Click "Browse" in the "Validate by File Upload" section
        </li>
        <li>Locate the local file and click "Open"
        </li>
        <li>Click "Check"</li>
        <li>If there are any errors, fix the first one, then repeat steps 1 through 4.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>The key thing is to get the green bar saying that your page is valid XHTML. If you see any yellow warnings about being tentatively valid, this is okay.
        Red errors are not okay</p>
        <hr>
    </div>

    <h1>Exercise 4: Upload Your Page to the Web</h1>
    <p>You can publish your page by uploading your files to the CIS department server cis-linux2.cis.temple.edu. Create a folder "aboutme" in the
        "~/public_html/" folder with permission 711. All files in "aboutme" folder need permission 644. Verify that you did this successfully by viewing your
        page in the web browser.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1>Exercise 5 (advanced): Advanced Style Techniques</h1>
        <p>If you manage to complete the first four exercises before lab time is up, edit your stylesheet to also do the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Your hyperlinks should not have an underline by default. When a user hovers over the link, the underline should appear. 
                Hint: The property you are looking for is a type of CSS "pseudo-class".
                </li>
                <li>
                    Every paragraph should start with a drop-caps that is 1.5 times the size of the normal paragraph font size.
                    Hint: The property you are looking for is a type of CSS "pseudo-element".
                    </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These are techniques that we have not covered in class, so you will need to use Google or a CSS reference such as <a href="W3Schools">W3Schools</a> to figure out how to get
            this done. Once again, you should be able to make these stylistic changes without modifying your HTML.
            </p>
